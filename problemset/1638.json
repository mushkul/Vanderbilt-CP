{"Title": "Grid Paths", "Category": "Dynamic Programming", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Consider an n \\times n grid whose squares may have traps. It is not allowed to move to a square with a trap. \n Your task is to calculate the number of paths from the upper-left square to the lower-right square. You can only move right or down. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the size of the grid. \n After this, there are n lines that describe the grid. Each line has n characters: . denotes an empty cell, and * denotes a trap. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the number of paths modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 1000", "Example Input": "4\n....\n.*..\n...*\n*...", "Example Output": "3", "Number": 1638}
