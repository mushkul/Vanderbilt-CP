{"Title": "String Functions", "Category": "String Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "We consider a string of n characters, indexed 1,2,\\dots,n. Your task is to calculate all values of the following functions: \n \nz(i) denotes the maximum length of a substring that begins at position i and is a prefix of the string. In addition, z(1)=0.\n\\pi(i) denotes the maximum length of a substring that ends at position i, is a prefix of the string, and whose length is at most i-1.\n \n Note that the function z is used in the Z-algorithm, and the function \\pi is used in the KMP algorithm. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The only input line has a string of length n. Each character is between a\u2013z. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print two lines: first the values of the z function, and then the values of the \\pi function. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^6", "Example Input": "abaabca", "Example Output": "0 0 1 2 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 2 0 1", "Number": 2107}
