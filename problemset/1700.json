{"Title": "Tree Isomorphism I", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given two rooted trees, your task is to find out if they are isomorphic, i.e., it is possible to draw them so that they look the same. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer t: the number of tests. Then, there are t tests described as follows: \n The first line has an integer n: the number of nodes in both trees. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n, and node 1 is the root. \n Then, there are n-1 lines describing the edges of the first tree, and finally n-1 lines describing the edges of the second tree. \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each test, print \"YES\", if the trees are isomorphic, and \"NO\" otherwise. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le t \\le 1000\n2 \\le n \\le 10^5\nthe sum of all values of n is at most 10^5", "Example Input": "2\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 2\n1 3\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3 2", "Example Output": "NO\nYES", "Number": 1700}
