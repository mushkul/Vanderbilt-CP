{"Title": "Graph Paths I", "Category": "Mathematics", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Consider a directed graph that has n nodes and m edges. Your task is to count the number of paths from node 1 to node n with exactly k edges. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains three integers n, m and k: the number of nodes and edges, and the length of the path. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Then, there are m lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge from node a to node b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the number of paths modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 100\n1 \\le m \\le n(n-1)\n1 \\le k \\le 10^9\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "3 4 8\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n3 2", "Example Output": "2", "Number": 1723}
