{"Title": "Distance Queries", "Category": "Tree Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given a tree consisting of n nodes. \n Your task is to process q queries of the form: what is the distance between nodes a and b? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains two integers n and q: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. \n Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. \n Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line contains two integer a and b: what is the distance between nodes a and b? \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print q integers: the answer to each query. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 3\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n1 3\n2 5\n1 4", "Example Output": "1\n3\n2", "Number": 1135}
