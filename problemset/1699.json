You are given m requests which routes should be possible to travel. \n Your task is to determine the minimum number of one-way flight connections which makes it possible to fulfil all requests. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and requests. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are m lines describing the requests. Each line has two integers a and b: there has to be a route from city a to city b. Each request is unique. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the minimum number of flight connections. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a, b \\le n", "Example Input": "4 5\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n3 1\n3 4", "Example Output": "4", "Number": 1699}
