{"Title": "Graph Girth", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given an undirected graph, your task is to determine its girth, i.e., the length of its shortest cycle. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. \n You may assume that there is at most one edge between each two nodes. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the girth of the graph. If there are no cycles, print -1. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2500\n1 \\le m \\le 5000", "Example Input": "5 6\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 4\n4 5", "Example Output": "3", "Number": 1707}
