{"Title": "Line Segment Intersection", "Category": "Geometry", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are two line segments: the first goes through the points (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2), and the second goes through the points (x_3,y_3) and (x_4,y_4). \n Your task is to determine if the line segments intersect, i.e., they have at least one common point. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer t: the number of tests. \n After this, there are t lines that describe the tests. Each line has eight integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4 and y_4. \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each test, print \"YES\" if the line segments intersect and \"NO\" otherwise. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le t \\le 10^5\n-10^9 \\le x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 \\le 10^9\n(x_1,y_1) \\neq (x_2,y_2)\n(x_3,y_3) \\neq (x_4,y_4)", "Example Input": "5\n1 1 5 3 1 2 4 3\n1 1 5 3 1 1 4 3\n1 1 5 3 2 3 4 1\n1 1 5 3 2 4 4 1\n1 1 5 3 3 2 7 4", "Example Output": "NO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES", "Number": 2190}
