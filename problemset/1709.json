On each move, you can remove all coins in a row or column. \n What is the minimum number of moves after which the grid is empty? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the size of the grid. The rows and columns are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are n lines describing the grid. Each line has n characters: each character is either . (empty) or o (coin). \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print an integer k: the minimum number of moves. After this, print k lines describing the moves. \n On each line, first print 1 (row) or 2 (column), and then the number of a row or column.
