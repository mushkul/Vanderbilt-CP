{"Title": "Dynamic Connectivity", "Category": "Advanced Techniques", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Consider an undirected graph that consists of n nodes and m edges. There are two types of events that can happen: \n \nA new edge is created between nodes a and b.\nAn existing edge between nodes a and b is removed.\n \n Your task is to report the number of components after every event. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has three integers n, m and k: the number of nodes, edges and events. \n After this there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. There is at most one edge between any pair of nodes. \n Then there are k lines describing the events. Each line has the form \"t a b\" where t is 1 (create a new edge) or 2 (remove an edge). A new edge is always created between two nodes that do not already have an edge between them, and only existing edges can get removed. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print k+1 integers: first the number of components before the first event, and after this the new number of components after each event. \n", "Constraints": "2 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m,k \\le 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 3 3\n1 4\n2 3\n3 5\n1 2 5\n2 3 5\n1 1 2", "Example Output": "2 2 2 1", "Number": 2133}
