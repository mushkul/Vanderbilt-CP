{"Title": "Shortest Routes I", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are n cities and m flight connections between them. Your task is to determine the length of the shortest route from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to every city. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flight connections. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n, and city 1 is Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4. \n After that, there are m lines describing the flight connections. Each line has three integers a, b and c: a flight begins at city a, ends at city b, and its length is c. Each flight is a one-way flight. \n You can assume that it is possible to travel from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to all other cities. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print n integers: the shortest route lengths from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to cities 1,2,\\dots,n. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n\n1 \\le c \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "3 4\n1 2 6\n1 3 2\n3 2 3\n1 3 4", "Example Output": "0 5 2", "Number": 1671}
