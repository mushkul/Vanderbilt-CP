    "Description": "Your task is to maintain an array of n values and efficiently process the following types of queries: \n \nIncrease each value in range [a,b] by x.\nSet each value in range [a,b] to x.\nCalculate the sum of values in range [a,b].\n \n",
    "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and q: the array size and the number of queries. \n The next line has n values t_1,t_2,\\dots,t_n: the initial contents of the array. \n Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. The format of each line is one of the following: \"1 a b x\",  \"2 a b x\", or \"3 a b\". \n",
    "Output Specification": "\n Print the answer to each sum query. \n",
    "Constraints": "1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le t_i, x \\le 10^6\n1 \\le a \\le b \\le n",
