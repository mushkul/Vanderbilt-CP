{"Title": "Weird Algorithm", "Category": "Introductory Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:\n 3 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 16 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1\nYour task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The only input line contains an integer n. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print a line that contains all values of n during the algorithm. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^6", "Example Input": "3", "Example Output": "3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1", "Number": 1068}
