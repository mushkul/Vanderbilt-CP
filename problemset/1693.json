{"Title": "Teleporters Path", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "A game has n levels and m teleportes between them. You win the game if you move from level 1 to level n using every teleporter exactly once. \n Can you win the game, and what is a possible way to do it? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of levels and teleporters. The levels are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Then, there are m lines describing the teleporters. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a teleporter from level a to level b. \n You can assume that each pair (a,b) in the input is distinct. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print m+1 integers: the sequence in which you visit the levels during the game. You can print any valid solution. \n If there are no solutions, print \"IMPOSSIBLE\". \n", "Constraints": "2 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 6\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 1\n4 2", "Example Output": "1 3 1 2 4 2 5", "Number": 1693}
