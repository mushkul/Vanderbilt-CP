{"Title": "Counting Towers", "Category": "Dynamic Programming", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Your task is to build a tower whose width is 2 and height is n. You have an unlimited supply of blocks whose width and height are integers. \n For example, here are some possible solutions for n=6:\n\nGiven n, how many different towers can you build? Mirrored and rotated towers are counted separately if they look different. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains an integer t: the number of tests. \n After this, there are t lines, and each line contains an integer n: the height of the tower. \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each test, print the number of towers modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le t \\le 100\n1 \\le n \\le 10^6", "Example Input": "3\n2\n6\n1337", "Example Output": "8\n2864\n640403945", "Number": 2413}
