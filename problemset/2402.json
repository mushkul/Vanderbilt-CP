{"Title": "Two Stacks Sorting", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given an input list that consists of n numbers. Each integer between 1 and n appears exactly once in the list. \n Your task is to create a sorted output list using two stacks. On each move you can do one of the following: \n \nMove the first number from the input list to a stack\nMove a number from a stack to the end of the output list\n \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n. \n The second line has n integers: the contents of the input list. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print n integers: for each number the stack where it is moved (1 or 2). \n You can print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, print \"IMPOSSIBLE\". \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5", "Example Input": "5\n2 3 1 5 4", "Example Output": "1 2 1 1 2", "Number": 2402}
