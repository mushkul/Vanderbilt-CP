{"Title": "Convex Hull", "Category": "Geometry", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given a set of n points in the two-dimensional plane, your task is to determine the convex hull of the points. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the number of points. \n After this, there are n lines that describe the points. Each line has two integers x and y: the coordinates of a point. \n You may assume that each point is distinct, and the area of the hull is positive. \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print an integer k: the number of points in the convex hull. \n After this, print k lines that describe the points. You can print the points in any order. Print all points that lie on the convex hull. \n", "Constraints": "3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n-10^9 \\le x, y \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "6\n2 1\n2 5\n3 3\n4 3\n4 4\n6 3", "Example Output": "4\n2 1\n2 5\n4 4\n6 3", "Number": 2195}
