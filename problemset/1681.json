{"Title": "Game Routes", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "A game has n levels, connected by m teleporters, and your task is to get from level 1 to level n. The game has been designed so that there are no directed cycles in the underlying graph. In how many ways can you complete the game? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of levels and teleporters. The levels are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are m lines describing the teleporters. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a teleporter from level a to level b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the number of ways you can complete the game. Since the result may be large, print it modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "4 5\n1 2\n2 4\n1 3\n3 4\n1 4", "Example Output": "3", "Number": 1681}
