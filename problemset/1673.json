{"Title": "High Score", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You play a game consisting of n rooms and m tunnels. Your initial score is 0, and each tunnel increases your score by x where x may be both positive or negative. You may go through a tunnel several times. \n Your task is to walk from room 1 to room n. What is the maximum score you can get? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of rooms and tunnels. The rooms are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Then, there are m lines describing the tunnels. Each line has three integers a, b and x: the tunnel starts at room a, ends at room b, and it increases your score by x. All tunnels are one-way tunnels. \n You can assume that it is possible to get from room 1 to room n. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the maximum score you can get. However, if you can get an arbitrarily large score, print -1. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2500\n1 \\le m \\le 5000\n1 \\le a,b \\le n\n-10^9 \\le x \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "4 5\n1 2 3\n2 4 -1\n1 3 -2\n3 4 7\n1 4 4", "Example Output": "5", "Number": 1673}
