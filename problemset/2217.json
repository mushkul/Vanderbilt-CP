{"Title": "Collecting Numbers II", "Category": "Sorting and Searching", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given an array that contains each number between 1 \\dots n exactly once. Your task is to collect the numbers from 1 to n in increasing order. \n On each round, you go through the array from left to right and collect as many numbers as possible. \n Given m operations that swap two numbers in the array, your task is to report the number of rounds after each operation. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first line has two integers n and m: the array size and the number of operations. \n The next line has n integers x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n: the numbers in the array. \n Finally, there are m lines that describe the operations. Each line has two integers a and b: the numbers at positions a and b are swapped. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print m integers: the number of rounds after each swap. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 3\n4 2 1 5 3\n2 3\n1 5\n2 3", "Example Output": "2\n3\n4", "Number": 2217}
