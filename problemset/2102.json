Finally, there are k lines that describe the patterns. \n The string and the patterns consist of characters a\u2013z. \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each pattern, print \"YES\" if it appears in the string and \"NO\" otherwise. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le k \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5\nthe total length of the patterns is at most 5 \\cdot 10^5", "Example Input": "aybabtu\n3\nbab\nabc\nayba", "Example Output": "YES\nNO\nYES", "Number": 2102}
