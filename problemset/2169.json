{"Title": "Nested Ranges Count", "Category": "Sorting and Searching", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given n ranges, your task is to count for each range how many other ranges it contains and how many other ranges contain it. \n Range [a,b] contains range [c,d] if a \\le c and d \\le b. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the number of ranges. \n After this, there are n lines that describe the ranges. Each line has two integers x and y: the range is [x,y]. \n You may assume that no range appears more than once in the input. \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print a line that describes for each range (in the input order) how many other ranges it contains. \n Then print a line that describes for each range (in the input order) how many other ranges contain it. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le x < y \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "4\n1 6\n2 4\n4 8\n3 6", "Example Output": "2 0 0 0\n0 1 0 1", "Number": 2169}
