{"Title": "Sliding Window Cost", "Category": "Sorting and Searching", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given an array of n integers. Your task is to calculate for each window of k elements, from left to right, the minimum total cost of making all elements equal. \n You can increase or decrease each element with cost x where x is the difference between the new and the original value. The total cost is the sum of such costs. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains two integers n and k: the number of elements and the size of the window. \n Then there are n integers x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n: the contents of the array. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Output n-k+1 values: the costs. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le x_i \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "8 3\n2 4 3 5 8 1 2 1", "Example Output": "2 2 5 7 7 1", "Number": 1077}
