{"Title": "Point in Polygon", "Category": "Geometry", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given a polygon of n vertices and a list of m points. Your task is to determine for each point if it is inside, outside or on the boundary of the polygon. \n The polygon consists of n vertices (x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\\dots,(x_n,y_n). The vertices (x_i,y_i) and (x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) are adjacent for i=1,2,\\dots,n-1, and the vertices (x_1,y_1) and (x_n,y_n) are also adjacent. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of vertices in the polygon and the number of points. \n After this, there are n lines that describe the polygon. The ith such line has two integers x_i and y_i. \n You may assume that the polygon is simple, i.e., it does not intersect itself. \n Finally, there are m lines that describe the points. Each line has two integers x and y. \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each point, print \"INSIDE\", \"OUTSIDE\" or \"BOUNDARY\". \n", "Constraints": "3 \\le n,m \\le 1000\n1 \\le m \\le 1000\n-10^9 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^9\n-10^9 \\le x, y \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "4 3\n1 1\n4 2\n3 5\n1 4\n2 3\n3 1\n1 3", "Example Output": "INSIDE\nOUTSIDE\nBOUNDARY", "Number": 2192}
