{"Title": "Stick Game", "Category": "Mathematics", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Consider a game where two players remove sticks from a heap. The players move alternately, and the player who removes the last stick wins the game. \n A set P=\\{p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k\\} determines the allowed moves. For example, if P=\\{1,3,4\\}, a player may remove 1, 3 or 4 sticks. \n Your task is find out for each number of sticks 1,2,\\dots,n if the first player has a winning or losing position. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and k: the number of sticks and moves. \n The next line has k integers p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_k that describe the allowed moves. All integers are distinct, and one of them is 1. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print a string containing n characters: W means a winning position, and L means a losing position. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^6\n1 \\le k \\le 100\n1 \\le p_i \\le n", "Example Input": "10 3\n1 3 4", "Example Output": "WLWWWWLWLW", "Number": 1729}
