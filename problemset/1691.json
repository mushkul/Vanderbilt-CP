For this reason, you want to find a route whose starting and ending point are the post office, and that goes through every street exactly once. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of crossings and streets. The crossings are numbered 1,\\,2,\\ldots,\\,n, and the post office is located at crossing 1. \n After that, there are m lines describing the streets. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a street between crossings a and b. All streets are two-way streets. \n Every street is between two different crossings, and there is at most one street between two crossings. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print all the crossings on the route in the order you will visit them. You can print any valid solution. \n If there are no solutions, print \"IMPOSSIBLE\". \n", "Constraints": "", "Example Input": "6 8\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n2 4\n2 6\n3 5\n3 6\n4 5", "Example Output": "1 2 6 3 2 4 5 3 1", "Number": 1691}
