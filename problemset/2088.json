The cost of such a move is the sum of values in the chosen subarray. \n What is the minimum total cost if you act optimally? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the array size. The array elements are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n The second line has n integers x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n: the contents of the array. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the minimum total cost. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 5000\n1 \\le x_i \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "5\n2 7 3 2 5", "Example Output": "43", "Number": 2088}
