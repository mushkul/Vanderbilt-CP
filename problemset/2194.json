{"Title": "Minimum Euclidean Distance", "Category": "Geometry", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given a set of points in the two-dimensional plane, your task is to find the minimum Euclidean distance between two distinct points. \n The Euclidean distance of points (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) is \\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the number of points. \n After this, there are n lines that describe the points. Each line has two integers x and y. You may assume that each point is distinct. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: d^2 where d is the minimum Euclidean distance (this ensures that the result is an integer). \n", "Constraints": "2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n-10^9 \\le x,y \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "4\n2 1\n4 4\n1 2\n6 3", "Example Output": "2", "Number": 2194}
