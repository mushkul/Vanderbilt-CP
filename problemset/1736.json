{"Title": "Polynomial Queries", "Category": "Range Queries", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Your task is to maintain an array of n values and efficiently process the following types of queries: \n \nIncrease the first value in range [a,b] by 1, the second value by 2, the third value by 3, and so on.\nCalculate the sum of values in range [a,b].\n \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and q: the size of the array and the number of queries. \n The next line has n values t_1,t_2,\\dots,t_n: the initial contents of the array. \n Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. The format of each line is either \"1 a b\" or \"2 a b\". \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the answer to each sum query. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le t_i \\le 10^6\n1 \\le a \\le b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 3\n4 2 3 1 7\n2 1 5\n1 1 5\n2 1 5", "Example Output": "17\n32", "Number": 1736}
