{"Title": "Strongly Connected Edges", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given an undirected graph, your task is to choose a direction for each edge so that the resulting directed graph is strongly connected. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. \n You may assume that the graph is simple, i.e., there are at most one edge between two nodes and every edge connects two distinct nodes. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print m lines describing the directions of the edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is an edge from node a to node b. You can print any valid solution. \n If there are no solutions, only print \"IMPOSSIBLE\". \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3", "Example Output": "1 2\n2 3\n3 1", "Number": 2177}
