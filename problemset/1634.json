{"Title": "Minimizing Coins", "Category": "Dynamic Programming", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Consider a money system consisting of n coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. Your task is to produce a sum of money x using the available coins in such a way that the number of coins is minimal. \n For example, if the coins are \\{1,5,7\\} and the desired sum is 11, an optimal solution is 5+5+1 which requires 3 coins. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and x: the number of coins and the desired sum of money. \n The second line has n distinct integers c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_n: the value of each coin. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the minimum number of coins. If it is not possible to produce the desired sum, print -1. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 100\n1 \\le x \\le 10^6\n1 \\le c_i \\le 10^6", "Example Input": "3 11\n1 5 7", "Example Output": "3", "Number": 1634}
