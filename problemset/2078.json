{"Title": "Eulerian Subgraphs", "Category": "Advanced Techniques", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given an undirected graph that has n nodes and m edges. \n We consider subgraphs that have all nodes of the original graph and some of its edges. A subgraph is called Eulerian if each node has even degree. \n Your task is to count the number of Eulerian subgraphs modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are m lines that describe the edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. There is at most one edge between two nodes, and each edge connects two distinct nodes. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the number of Eulerian subgraphs modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n0 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "4 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3", "Example Output": "2", "Number": 2078}
