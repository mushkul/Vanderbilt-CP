{"Title": "Flight Discount", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Your task is to find a minimum-price flight route from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to Mets\u00e4l\u00e4. You have one discount coupon, using which you can halve the price of any single flight during the route. However, you can only use the coupon once. \n When you use the discount coupon for a flight whose price is x, its price becomes \\lfloor x/2 \\rfloor (it is rounded down to an integer). \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flight connections. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. City 1 is Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4, and city n is Mets\u00e4l\u00e4. \n After this there are m lines describing the flights. Each line has three integers a, b, and c: a flight begins at city a, ends at city b, and its price is c. Each flight is unidirectional. \n You can assume that it is always possible to get from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to Mets\u00e4l\u00e4. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the price of the cheapest route from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to Mets\u00e4l\u00e4. \n", "Constraints": "2 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n\n1 \\le c \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "3 4\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n1 3 7\n2 1 5", "Example Output": "2", "Number": 1195}
