{"Title": "Stick Lengths", "Category": "Sorting and Searching", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are n sticks with some lengths. Your task is to modify the sticks so that each stick has the same length. \n You can either lengthen and shorten each stick. Both operations cost x where x is the difference between the new and original length. \n What is the minimum total cost? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains an integer n: the number of sticks. \n Then there are n integers: p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n: the lengths of the sticks. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the minimum total cost. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le p_i \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "5\n2 3 1 5 2", "Example Output": "5", "Number": 1074}
