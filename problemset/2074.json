The array elements are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n The next line as n integers x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n: the contents of the array. \n Finally, there are m lines that describe the operations. Each line has three integers t, a and b. If t=1, you should reverse a subarray from a to b. If t=2, you should calculate the sum of values from a to b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the answer to each operation where t=2. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 10^5\n0 \\le x_i \\le 10^9\n1 \\le a \\le b \\le n", "Example Input": "8 3\n2 1 3 4 5 3 4 4\n2 2 4\n1 3 6\n2 2 4", "Example Output": "8\n9", "Number": 2074}
