{"Title": "Giant Pizza", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Uolevi's family is going to order a large pizza and eat it together. A total of n family members will join the order, and there are m possible toppings. The pizza may have any number of toppings. \n Each family member gives two wishes concerning the toppings of the pizza. The wishes are of the form \"topping x is good/bad\". Your task is to choose the toppings so that at least one wish from everybody becomes true (a good topping is included in the pizza or a bad topping is not included). \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of family members and toppings. The toppings are numbered 1,2,\\dots,m. \n After this, there are n lines describing the wishes. Each line has two wishes of the form \"+ x\" (topping x is good) or \"- x\" (topping x is bad). \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print a line with m symbols: for each topping \"+\" if it is included and \"-\" if it is not included. You can print any valid solution. \n If there are no valid solutions, print \"IMPOSSIBLE\". \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n,m \\le 10^5\n1 \\le x \\le m", "Example Input": "3 5\n+ 1 + 2\n- 1 + 3\n+ 4 - 2", "Example Output": "- + + + -", "Number": 1684}
