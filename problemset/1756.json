{"Title": "Acyclic Graph Edges", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given an undirected graph, your task is to choose a direction for each edge so that the resulting directed graph is acyclic. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print m lines describing the directions of the edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is an edge from node a to node b. You can print any valid solution. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1", "Example Output": "1 2\n3 2\n3 1", "Number": 1756}
