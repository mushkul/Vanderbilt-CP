{"Title": "Palindrome Queries", "Category": "String Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given a string that consists of n characters between a\u2013z. The positions of the string are indexed 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Your task is to process m operations of the following types: \n \nChange the character at position k to x\nCheck if the substring from position a to position b is a palindrome\n \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the length of the string and the number of operations. \n The next line has a string that consists of n characters. \n Finally, there are m lines that describe the operations. Each line is of the form \"1 k x\" or \"2 a b\". \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each operation 2, print YES if the substring is a palindrome and NO otherwise. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le k \\le n\n1 \\le a \\le b \\le n", "Example Input": "7 5\naybabtu\n2 3 5\n1 3 x\n2 3 5\n1 5 x\n2 3 5", "Example Output": "YES\nNO\nYES", "Number": 2420}
