{"Title": "Message Route", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4's network has n computers and m connections. Your task is to find out if Uolevi can send a message to Maija, and if it is possible, what is the minimum number of computers on such a route. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of computers and connections. The computers are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. Uolevi's computer is 1 and Maija's computer is n. \n Then, there are m lines describing the connections. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a connection between those computers. \n Every connection is between two different computers, and there is at most one connection between any two computers. \n", "Output Specification": "\n If it is possible to send a message, first print k: the minimum number of computers on a valid route. After this, print an example of such a route. You can print any valid solution. \n If there are no routes, print \"IMPOSSIBLE\". \n", "Constraints": "2 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 5\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n5 4", "Example Output": "3\n1 4 5", "Number": 1667}
