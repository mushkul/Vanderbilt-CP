{"Title": "Tree Traversals", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are three common ways to traverse the nodes of a binary tree: \n \nPreorder: First process the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.\nInorder: First process the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.\nPostorder: First process the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.\n \n There is a binary tree of n nodes with distinct labels. You are given the preorder and inorder traversals of the tree, and your task is to determine its postorder traversal. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are two lines describing the preorder and inorder traversals of the tree. Both lines consist of n integers. \n You can assume that the input corresponds to a binary tree. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the postorder traversal of the tree. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5", "Example Input": "5\n5 3 2 1 4\n3 5 1 2 4", "Example Output": "3 1 4 2 5", "Number": 1702}
