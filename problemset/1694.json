{"Title": "Download Speed", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Consider a network consisting of n computers and m connections. Each connection specifies how fast a computer can send data to another computer. \n Kotivalo wants to download some data from a server. What is the maximum speed he can do this, using the connections in the network? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of computers and connections. The computers are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. Computer 1 is the server and computer n is Kotivalo's computer. \n After this, there are m lines describing the connections. Each line has three integers a, b and c: computer a can send data to computer b at speed c. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the maximum speed Kotivalo can download data. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 500\n1 \\le m \\le 1000\n1 \\le a,b \\le n\n1 \\le c \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "4 5\n1 2 3\n2 4 2\n1 3 4\n3 4 5\n4 1 3", "Example Output": "6", "Number": 1694}
