{"Title": "Distributing Apples", "Category": "Mathematics", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are n children and m apples that will be distributed to them. Your task is to count the number of ways this can be done. \n For example, if n=3 and m=2, there are 6 ways: [0,0,2], [0,1,1], [0,2,0], [1,0,1], [1,1,0] and [2,0,0]. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The only input line has two integers n and m. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the number of ways modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n,m \\le 10^6", "Example Input": "3 2", "Example Output": "6", "Number": 1716}
