{"Title": "Planets Queries I", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are playing a game consisting of n planets. Each planet has a teleporter to another planet (or the planet itself). \n Your task is to process q queries of the form: when you begin on planet x and travel through k teleporters, which planet will you reach? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and q: the number of planets and queries. The planets are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n The second line has n integers t_1,t_2,\\dots,t_n: for each planet, the destination of the teleporter. It is possible that t_i=i. \n Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers x and k: you start on planet x and travel through k teleporters. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the answer to each query. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le t_i \\le n\n1 \\le x \\le n\n0 \\le k \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "4 3\n2 1 1 4\n1 2\n3 4\n4 1", "Example Output": "1\n2\n4", "Number": 1750}
