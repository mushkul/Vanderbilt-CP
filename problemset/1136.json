{"Title": "Counting Paths", "Category": "Tree Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given a tree consisting of n nodes, and m paths in the tree. \n Your task is to calculate for each node the number of paths containing that node. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains integers n and m: the number of nodes and paths. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. \n Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. \n Finally, there are m lines describing the paths. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is a path between nodes a and b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print n integers: for each node 1,2,\\ldots,n, the number of paths containing that node. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 3\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n1 3\n2 5\n1 4", "Example Output": "3 1 3 1 1", "Number": 1136}
