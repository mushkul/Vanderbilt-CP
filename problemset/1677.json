{"Title": "Network Breakdown", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4's network has n computers and m connections between them. The network consists of components of computers that can send messages to each other. \n Nobody in Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 understands how the network works. For this reason, if a connection breaks down, nobody will repair it. In this situation a component may be divided into two components. \n Your task is to calculate the number of components after each connection breakdown. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has three integers n, m and k: the number of computers, connections and breakdowns. The computers are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Then, there are m lines describing the connections. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a connection between computers a and b. Each connection is between two different computers, and there is at most one connection between two computers. \n Finally, there are k lines describing the breakdowns. Each line has two integers a and b: the connection between computers a and b breaks down. \n", "Output Specification": "\n After each breakdown, print the number of components. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le k \\le m\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 5 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n3 4\n2 3\n4 5", "Example Output": "2 2 3", "Number": 1677}
