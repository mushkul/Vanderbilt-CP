{"Title": "Polygon Lattice Points", "Category": "Geometry", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given a polygon, your task is to calculate the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary. A lattice point is a point whose coordinates are integers. \n The polygon consists of n vertices (x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\\dots,(x_n,y_n). The vertices (x_i,y_i) and (x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) are adjacent for i=1,2,\\dots,n-1, and the vertices (x_1,y_1) and (x_n,y_n) are also adjacent. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the number of vertices. \n After this, there are n lines that describe the vertices. The ith such line has two integers x_i and y_i. \n You may assume that the polygon is simple, i.e., it does not intersect itself. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print two integers: the number of lattice points inside the polygon and on its boundary. \n", "Constraints": "3 \\le n \\le 10^5\n-10^9 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "4\n1 1\n5 3\n3 5\n1 4", "Example Output": "6 8", "Number": 2193}
