{"Title": "Tree Diameter", "Category": "Tree Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given a tree consisting of n nodes. \n The diameter of a tree is the maximum distance between two nodes. Your task is to determine the diameter of the tree. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. \n Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the diameter of the tree. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5", "Example Output": "3", "Number": 1131}
