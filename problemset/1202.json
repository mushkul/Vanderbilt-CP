You would like to find answers to the following questions: \n \nwhat is the minimum price of such a route?\nhow many minimum-price routes are there? (modulo 10^9+7)\nwhat is the minimum number of flights in a minimum-price route?\nwhat is the maximum number of flights in a minimum-price route?\n \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains two integers n and m: the number of cities and the number of flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. City 1 is Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4, and city n is Lehm\u00e4l\u00e4. \n After this, there are m lines describing the flights. Each line has three integers a, b, and c: there is a flight from city a to city b with price c. All flights are one-way flights. \n You may assume that there is a route from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to Lehm\u00e4l\u00e4. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print four integers according to the problem statement. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n\n1 \\le c \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "4 5\n1 4 5\n1 2 4\n2 4 5\n1 3 2\n3 4 3", "Example Output": "5 2 1 2", "Number": 1202}
