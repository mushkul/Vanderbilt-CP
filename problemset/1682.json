{"Title": "Flight Routes Check", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are n cities and m flight connections. Your task is to check if you can travel from any city to any other city using the available flights. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are m lines describing the flights. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a flight from city a to city b. All flights are one-way flights. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print \"YES\" if all routes are possible, and \"NO\" otherwise. In the latter case also print two cities a and b such that you cannot travel from city a to city b. If there are several possible solutions, you can print any of them. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "4 5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n1 4\n3 4", "Example Output": "NO\n4 2", "Number": 1682}
