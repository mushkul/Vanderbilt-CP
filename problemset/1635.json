{"Title": "Coin Combinations I", "Category": "Dynamic Programming", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Consider a money system consisting of n coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. Your task is to calculate the number of distinct ways you can produce a money sum x using the available coins. \n For example, if the coins are \\{2,3,5\\} and the desired sum is 9, there are 8 ways: \n \n2+2+5\n2+5+2\n5+2+2\n3+3+3\n2+2+2+3\n2+2+3+2\n2+3+2+2\n3+2+2+2\n \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and x: the number of coins and the desired sum of money. \n The second line has n distinct integers c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_n: the value of each coin. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the number of ways modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 100\n1 \\le x \\le 10^6\n1 \\le c_i \\le 10^6", "Example Input": "3 9\n2 3 5", "Example Output": "8", "Number": 1635}
