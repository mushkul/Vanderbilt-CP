{"Title": "Moving Robots", "Category": "Mathematics", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Each square of an 8 \\times 8 chessboard has a robot. Each robot independently moves k steps, and there can be many robots on the same square. \n On each turn, a robot moves one step left, right, up or down, but not outside the board. It randomly chooses a direction among those where it can move. \n Your task is to calculate the expected number of empty squares after k turns. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The only input line has an integer k. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the expected number of empty squares rounded to six decimal places (rounding half to even). \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le k \\le 100", "Example Input": "10", "Example Output": "23.120740", "Number": 1726}
