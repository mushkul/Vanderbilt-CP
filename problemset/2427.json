{"Title": "Letter Pair Move Game", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are 2n boxes in a line. Two adjacent boxes are empty, and all other boxes have a letter \"A\" or \"B\". Both letters appear in exactly n-1 boxes. \n Your task is to move the letters so that all letters \"A\" appear before any letter \"B\". On each turn you can choose any two adjacent boxes that have a letter and move the letters to the two adjacent empty boxes, preserving their order. \n It can be proven that either there is a solution that consists of at most 10n turns or there are no solutions. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first line has an integer n: there are 2n boxes. \n The second line has a string of 2n characters which describes the starting position. Each character is \"A\", \"B\" or \".\" (empty box). \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print an integer k: the number of turns. After this, print k lines that describe the moves. You can print any solution, as long as k \\le 1000. \n If there are no solutions, print only \"-1\". \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 100", "Example Input": "", "Example Output": "", "Number": 2427}
