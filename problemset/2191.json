{"Title": "Polygon Area", "Category": "Geometry", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Your task is to calculate the area of a given polygon. \n The polygon consists of n vertices (x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\\dots,(x_n,y_n). The vertices (x_i,y_i) and (x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) are adjacent for i=1,2,\\dots,n-1, and the vertices (x_1,y_1) and (x_n,y_n) are also adjacent. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the number of vertices. \n After this, there are n lines that describe the vertices. The ith such line has two integers x_i and y_i. \n You may assume that the polygon is simple, i.e., it does not intersect itself. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: 2a where the area of the polygon is a (this ensures that the result is an integer). \n", "Constraints": "3 \\le n \\le 1000\n-10^9 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "4\n1 1\n4 2\n3 5\n1 4", "Example Output": "16", "Number": 2191}
