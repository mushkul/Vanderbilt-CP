{"Title": "Distinct Colors", "Category": "Tree Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given a rooted tree consisting of n nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n, and node 1 is the root. Each node has a color. \n Your task is to determine for each node the number of distinct colors in the subtree of the node. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. \n The next line consists of n integers c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_n: the color of each node. \n Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print n integers: for each node 1,2,\\ldots,n, the number of distinct colors. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n\n1 \\le c_i \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "5\n2 3 2 2 1\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5", "Example Output": "3 1 2 1 1", "Number": 1139}
