The cost of each subarray is the square of the sum of the values in the subarray. What is the minimum total cost if you act optimally? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and k: the array elements and the number of subarrays. The array elements are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n The second line has n integers x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n: the contents of the array. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the minimum total cost. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le k \\le n \\le 3000\n1 \\le x_i \\le 10^5", "Example Input": "8 3\n2 3 1 2 2 3 4 1", "Example Output": "110", "Number": 2086}
