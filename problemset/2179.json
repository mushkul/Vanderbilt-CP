{"Title": "Even Outdegree Edges", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given an undirected graph, your task is to choose a direction for each edge so that in the resulting directed graph each node has an even outdegree. The outdegree of a node is the number of edges coming out of that node. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. \n You may assume that the graph is simple, i.e., there is at most one edge between any two nodes and every edge connects two distinct nodes. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print m lines describing the directions of the edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is an edge from node a to node b. You can print any valid solution. \n If there are no solutions, only print \"IMPOSSIBLE\". \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "4 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n1 4", "Example Output": "1 2\n3 2\n3 4\n1 4", "Number": 2179}
