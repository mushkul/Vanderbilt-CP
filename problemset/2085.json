However, on level n you must kill the final monster to win the game. \n Killing a monster takes sf time where s is the monster's strength and f is your skill factor. After killing a monster, you get a new skill factor  (lower skill factor is better). What is the minimum total time in which you can win the game? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and x: the number of levels and your initial skill factor. \n The second line has n integers s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_n: each monster's strength. \n The third line has n integers f_1,f_2,\\dots,f_n: your new skill factor after killing a monster. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the minimum total time to win the game. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le x \\le 10^6\n1 \\le s_i, f_i \\le 10^6", "Example Input": "5 100\n50 20 30 90 30\n60 20 20 10 90", "Example Output": "2600", "Number": 2085}
