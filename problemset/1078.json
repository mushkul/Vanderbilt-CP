{"Title": "Grid Paths", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Consider an n \\times n grid whose top-left square is (1,1) and bottom-right square is (n,n). \n Your task is to move from the top-left square to the bottom-right square. On each step you may move one square right or down. In addition, there are m traps in the grid. You cannot move to a square with a trap. \n What is the total number of possible paths? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains two integers n and m: the size of the grid and the number of traps. \n After this, there are m lines describing the traps. Each such line contains two integers y and x: the location of a trap. \n You can assume that there are no traps in the top-left and bottom-right square. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the number of paths modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^6\n1 \\le m \\le 1000\n1 \\le y,x \\le n", "Example Input": "3 1\n2 2", "Example Output": "2", "Number": 1078}
