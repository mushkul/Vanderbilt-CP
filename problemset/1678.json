{"Title": "Round Trip II", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Byteland has n cities and m flight connections. Your task is to design a round trip that begins in a city, goes through one or more other cities, and finally returns to the starting city. Every intermediate city on the route has to be distinct. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Then, there are m lines describing the flights. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a flight connection from city a to city b. All connections are one-way flights from a city to another city. \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print an integer k: the number of cities on the route. Then print k cities in the order they will be visited. You can print any valid solution. \n If there are no solutions, print \"IMPOSSIBLE\". \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "4 5\n1 3\n2 1\n2 4\n3 2\n3 4", "Example Output": "4\n2 1 3 2", "Number": 1678}
