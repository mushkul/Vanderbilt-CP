Kaaleppi is currently in city a and wants to travel to city b. \n However, there is a problem: Kaaleppi has recently robbed a bank in city c and can't enter the city, because the local police would catch him. Your task is to find out if there is a route from city a to city b that does not visit city c. \n As an additional challenge, you have to process q queries where a, b and c vary. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has three integers n, m and q: the number of cities, roads and queries. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Then, there are m lines describing the roads. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a road between cities a and b. Each road is bidirectional. \n Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has three integers a, b and c: is there a route from city a to city b that does not visit city c? \n You can assume that there is a route between any two cities. \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each query, print \"YES\", if there is such a route, and \"NO\" otherwise. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le q \\le 10^5\n1 \\le a,b,c \\le n", "Example Input": "5 6 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n2 4\n3 4\n4 5\n1 4 2\n3 5 4\n3 5 2", "Example Output": "YES\nNO\nYES", "Number": 1705}
