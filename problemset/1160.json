{"Title": "Planets Queries II", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are playing a game consisting of n planets. Each planet has a teleporter to another planet (or the planet itself). \n You have to process q queries of the form: You are now on planet a and want to reach planet b. What is the minimum number of teleportations? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains two integers n and q: the number of planets and queries. The planets are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. \n The second line contains n integers t_1,t_2,\\ldots,t_n: for each planet, the destination of the teleporter. \n Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers a and b: you are now on planet a and want to reach planet b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each query, print the minimum number of teleportations. If it is not possible to reach the destination, print -1. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 3\n2 3 2 3 2\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4", "Example Output": "1\n2\n-1", "Number": 1160}
