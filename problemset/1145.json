{"Title": "Increasing Subsequence", "Category": "Dynamic Programming", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given an array containing n integers. Your task is to determine the longest increasing subsequence in the array, i.e., the longest subsequence where every element is larger than the previous one. \n A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first line contains an integer n: the size of the array. \n After this there are n integers x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n: the contents of the array. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the length of the longest increasing subsequence. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le x_i \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "8\n7 3 5 3 6 2 9 8", "Example Output": "4", "Number": 1145}
