{"Title": "Inversion Probability", "Category": "Mathematics", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "An array has n integers x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n, and each of them has been randomly chosen between 1 and r_i. An inversion is a pair (a,b) where a<b and x_a>x_b. \n What is the expected number of inversions in the array? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains an integer n: the size of the array. \n The second line contains n integers r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_n: the range of possible values for each array position. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the expected number of inversions rounded to six decimal places (rounding half to even). \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 100\n1 \\le r_i \\le 100", "Example Input": "3\n5 2 7", "Example Output": "1.057143", "Number": 1728}
