{"Title": "Reversal Sorting", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You have an array that contains a permutation of integers 1,2,\\dots,n. Your task is to sort the array in increasing order by reversing subarrays. You can construct any solution that has at most n reversals. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the size of the array. The array elements are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n The next line has n integers x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n: the contents of the array. \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print an integer k: the number of reversals. \n After that, print k lines that describe the reversals. Each line has two integers a and b: you reverse a subarray from position a to position b. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5", "Example Input": "4\n2 3 1 4", "Example Output": "2\n1 3\n2 3", "Number": 2075}
