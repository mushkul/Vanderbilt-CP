Each line has four integers: x_1, y_1, x_2 and y_2: a line segment begins at point (x_1,y_1) and ends at point (x_2,y_2). \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the number of intersection points. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n-10^6 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le 10^6\n-10^6 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le 10^6\n(x_1,y_1) \\neq (x_2,y_2)", "Example Input": "3\n2 3 7 3\n3 1 3 5\n6 2 6 6", "Example Output": "2", "Number": 1740}
