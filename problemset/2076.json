{"Title": "Necessary Roads", "Category": "Advanced Techniques", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are n cities and m roads between them. There is a route between any two cities. \n A road is called necessary if there is no route between some two cities after removing that road. Your task is to find all necessary roads. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and roads. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are m lines that describe the roads. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a road between cities a and b. There is at most one road between two cities, and every road connects two distinct cities. \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print an integer k: the number of necessary roads. After that, print k lines that describe the roads. You may print the roads in any order. \n", "Constraints": "2 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 5\n1 2\n1 4\n2 4\n3 5\n4 5", "Example Output": "2\n3 5\n4 5", "Number": 2076}
