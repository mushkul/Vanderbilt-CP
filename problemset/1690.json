You want to travel from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to Lehm\u00e4l\u00e4 so that you visit each city exactly once. How many possible routes are there? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. City 1 is Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4, and city n is Lehm\u00e4l\u00e4. \n Then, there are m lines describing the flights. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a flight from city a to city b. All flights are one-way flights. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the number of routes modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Constraints": "2 \\le n \\le 20\n1 \\le m \\le n^2\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "4 6\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n3 2\n2 4\n3 4", "Example Output": "2", "Number": 1690}
