The edges are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Your task is to answer q queries of the form \"can you reach node b from node a?\" \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has three integers n, m and q: the number of nodes, edges and queries. \n Then there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integers a and b: there is an edge from node a to node b. \n Finally there are q lines describing the queries. Each line consists of two integers a and b: \"can you reach node b from node a?\" \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the answer for each query: either \"YES\" or \"NO\". \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4\n1 \\le m,q \\le 10^5", "Example Input": "4 4 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n4 3\n1 3\n1 4\n4 1", "Example Output": "YES\nNO\nYES", "Number": 2143}
