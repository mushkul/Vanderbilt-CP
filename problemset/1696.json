Next week a school dance will be organized. A dance pair consists of a boy and a girl, and there are k potential pairs. \n Your task is to find out the maximum number of dance pairs and show how this number can be achieved. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has three integers n, m and k: the number of boys, girls, and potential pairs. The boys are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n, and the girls are numbered 1,2,\\dots,m. \n After this, there are k lines describing the potential pairs. Each line has two integers a and b: boy a and girl b are willing to dance together. \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print one integer r: the maximum number of dance pairs. After this, print r lines describing the pairs. You can print any valid solution. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n,m \\le 500\n1 \\le k \\le 1000\n1 \\le a \\le n\n1 \\le b \\le m", "Example Input": "3 2 4\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n3 1", "Example Output": "2\n1 2\n3 1", "Number": 1696}
