{"Title": "Substring Reversals", "Category": "Advanced Techniques", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given a string, your task is to process operations where you reverse a substring of the string. What is the final string after all the operations? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the length of the string and the number of operations. The characters of the string are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n The next line has a string of length n that consists of characters A\u2013Z. \n Finally, there are m lines that describe the operations. Each line has two integers a and b: you reverse a substring from position a to position b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the final string after all the operations. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a \\le b \\le n", "Example Input": "7 2\nAYBABTU\n3 4\n4 7", "Example Output": "AYAUTBB", "Number": 2073}
