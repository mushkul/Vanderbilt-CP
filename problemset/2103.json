{"Title": "Counting Patterns", "Category": "String Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given a string and patterns, count for each pattern the number of positions where it appears in the string. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has a string of length n. \n The next input line has an integer k: the number of patterns. Finally, there are k lines that describe the patterns. \n The string and the patterns consist of characters a\u2013z. \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each pattern, print the number of positions. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le k \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5\nthe total length of the patterns is at most 5 \\cdot 10^5", "Example Input": "aybabtu\n3\nbab\nabc\na", "Example Output": "1\n0\n2", "Number": 2103}
