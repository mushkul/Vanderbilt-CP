{"Title": "Monotone Subsequences", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Your task is to create a permutation of numbers 1,2,\\dots,n whose longest monotone subsequence has exactly k elements. \n A monotone subsequence is either increasing or decreasing. For example, some monotone subsequences in [2,1,4,5,3] are [2,4,5] and [4,3]. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer t: the number of tests. \n After this, there are t lines. Each line has two integers n and k. \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each test, print a line that contains the permutation. You can print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, print \"IMPOSSIBLE\". \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le t \\le 1000\n1 \\le k \\le n \\le 100", "Example Input": "3\n5 3\n5 2\n7 7", "Example Output": "2 1 4 5 3\nIMPOSSIBLE\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7", "Number": 2215}
