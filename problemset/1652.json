Each square is either empty or contains a tree. The upper-left square has coordinates (1,1), and the lower-right square has coordinates (n,n). \n Your task is to process q queries of the form: how many trees are inside a given rectangle in the forest? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and q: the size of the forest and the number of queries. \n Then, there are n lines describing the forest. Each line has n characters: . is an empty square and * is a tree. \n Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has four integers y_1, x_1, y_2, x_2 corresponding to the corners of a rectangle. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the number of trees inside each rectangle. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 1000\n1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le n\n1 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le n", "Example Input": "4 3\n.*..\n*.**\n**..\n****\n2 2 3 4\n3 1 3 1\n1 1 2 2", "Example Output": "3\n1\n2", "Number": 1652}
