Which cities will you certainly visit? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains two integers n and m: the number of cities and the number of flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. City 1 is Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4, and city n is Lehm\u00e4l\u00e4. \n After this, there are m lines describing the flights. Each line has three integers a, b, and c: there is a flight from city a to city b with price c. All flights are one-way flights. \n You may assume that there is a route from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to Lehm\u00e4l\u00e4. \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print an integer k: the number of cities that are certainly in the route. After this, print the k cities sorted in increasing order. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n\n1 \\le c \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "5 6\n1 2 3\n1 3 4\n2 3 1\n2 4 5\n3 4 1\n4 5 8", "Example Output": "4\n1 3 4 5", "Number": 1203}
