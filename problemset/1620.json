{"Title": "Factory Machines", "Category": "Sorting and Searching", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "A factory has n machines which can be used to make products. Your goal is to make a total of t products. \n For each machine, you know the number of seconds it needs to make a single product. The machines can work simultaneously, and you can freely decide their schedule. \n What is the shortest time needed to make t products? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and t: the number of machines and products. \n The next line has n integers k_1,k_2,\\dots,k_n: the time needed to make a product using each machine. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the minimum time needed to make t products. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le t \\le 10^9\n1 \\le k_i \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "3 7\n3 2 5", "Example Output": "8", "Number": 1620}
