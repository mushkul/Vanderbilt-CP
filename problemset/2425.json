{"Title": "Stack Weights", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You have n coins, each of which has a distinct weight. \n There are two stacks which are initially empty. On each step you move one coin to a stack. You never remove a coin from a stack. \n After each move, your task is to determine which stack is heavier (if we can be sure that either stack is heavier). \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the number of coins. The coins are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. You know that coin i is always heavier than coin i-1, but you don't know their exact weights. \n After this, there are n lines that describe the moves. Each line has two integers c and s: move coin c to stack s (1 = left, 2 = right). \n", "Output Specification": "\n After each move, print < if the right stack is heavier, > if the left stack is heavier, and ? if we can't know which stack is heavier. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5", "Example Input": "3\n2 1\n3 2\n1 1", "Example Output": ">\n<\n?", "Number": 2425}
