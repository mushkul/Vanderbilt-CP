{"Title": "Reachable Nodes", "Category": "Advanced Techniques", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "A directed acyclic graph consists of n nodes and m edges. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Calculate for each node the number of nodes you can reach from that node (including the node itself). \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges. \n Then there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has two distinct integers a and b: there is an edge from node a to node b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print n integers: for each node the number of reachable nodes. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4\n1 \\le m \\le 10^5", "Example Input": "5 6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n3 5\n4 5", "Example Output": "5 3 2 2 1", "Number": 2138}
