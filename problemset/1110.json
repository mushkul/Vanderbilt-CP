{"Title": "Minimal Rotation", "Category": "String Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "A rotation of a string can be generated by moving characters one after another from beginning to end. For example, the rotations of acab are acab, caba, abac, and baca. \n Your task is to determine the lexicographically minimal rotation of a string. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The only input line contains a string of length n. Each character is one of a\u2013z. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the lexicographically minimal rotation. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^6", "Example Input": "acab", "Example Output": "abac", "Number": 1110}
