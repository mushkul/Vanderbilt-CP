{"Title": "Inverse Inversions", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Your task is to create a permutation of numbers 1,2,\\dots,n that has exactly k inversions. \n An inversion is a pair (a,b) where a<b and p_a>p_b where p_i denotes the number at position i in the permutation. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The only input line has two integers n and k. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print a line that contains the permutation. You can print any valid solution. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^6\n0 \\le k \\le \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}", "Example Input": "5 4", "Example Output": "1 5 2 4 3", "Number": 2214}
