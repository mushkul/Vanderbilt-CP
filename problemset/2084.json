Each level has a monster. On levels 1,2,\\dots,n-1, you can either kill or escape the monster. However, on level n you must kill the final monster to win the game. \n Killing a monster takes sf time where s is the monster's strength and f is your skill factor (lower skill factor is better). After killing a monster, you get a new skill factor. What is the minimum total time in which you can win the game? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and x: the number of levels and your initial skill factor. \n The second line has n integers s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_n: each monster's strength. \n The third line has n integers f_1,f_2,\\dots,f_n: your new skill factor after killing a monster. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the minimum total time to win the game. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le x \\le 10^6\n1 \\le s_1 \\le s_2 \\le \\dots \\le s_n \\le 10^6\nx \\ge f_1 \\ge f_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge f_n \\ge 1", "Example Input": "5 100\n20 30 30 50 90\n90 60 20 20 10", "Example Output": "4800", "Number": 2084}
