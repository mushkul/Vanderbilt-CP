Two planets a and b belong to the same kingdom exactly when there is a route both from a to b and from b to a. Your task is to determine for each planet its kingdom. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of planets and teleporters. The planets are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are m lines describing the teleporters. Each line has two integers a and b: you can travel from planet a to planet b through a teleporter. \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print an integer k: the number of kingdoms. After this, print for each planet a kingdom label between 1 and k. You can print any valid solution. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 6\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n3 4\n4 5\n5 4", "Example Output": "2\n1 1 1 2 2", "Number": 1683}
