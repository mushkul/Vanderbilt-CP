{"Title": "Missing Coin Sum Queries", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You have n coins with positive integer values. The coins are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Your task is to process q queries of the form: \"if you can use coins a \\dots b, what is the smallest sum you cannot produce?\" \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and q: the number of coins and queries. \n The second line has n integers x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n: the value of each coin. \n Finally, there are q lines that describe the queries. Each line has two values a and b: you can use coins a \\dots b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the answer for each query. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le x_i \\le 10^9\n1 \\le a \\le b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 3\n2 9 1 2 7\n2 4\n4 4\n1 5", "Example Output": "4\n1\n6", "Number": 2184}
