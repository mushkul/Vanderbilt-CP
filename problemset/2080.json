{"Title": "Fixed-Length Paths I", "Category": "Tree Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given a tree of n nodes, your task is to count the number of distinct paths that consist of exactly k edges. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains two integers n and k: the number of nodes and the path length. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. \n Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the number of paths. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n3 5", "Example Output": "4", "Number": 2080}
