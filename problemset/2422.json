{"Title": "Multiplication Table", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Find the middle element when the numbers in an n \\times n multiplication table are sorted in increasing order. It is assumed that n is odd. \n For example, the 3 \\times 3 multiplication table is as follows:\n\n\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n3 & 6 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{matrix}\n\nThe numbers in increasing order are [1,2,2,3,3,4,6,6,9], so the answer is 3. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The only input line has an integer n. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the answer to the task. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n < 10^6", "Example Input": "3", "Example Output": "3", "Number": 2422}
