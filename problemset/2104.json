Finally, there are k lines that describe the patterns. \n The string and the patterns consist of characters a\u2013z. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the first position for each pattern (or -1 if it does not appear at all). \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le k \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5\nthe total length of the patterns is at most 5 \\cdot 10^5", "Example Input": "aybabtu\n3\nbab\nabc\na", "Example Output": "3\n-1\n1", "Number": 2104}
