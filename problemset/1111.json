{"Title": "Longest Palindrome", "Category": "String Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given a string, your task is to determine the longest palindromic substring of the string. For example, the longest palindrome in aybabtu is bab. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The only input line contains a string of length n. Each character is one of a\u2013z. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the longest palindrome in the string. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^6", "Example Input": "aybabtu", "Example Output": "bab", "Number": 1111}
