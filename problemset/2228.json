{"Title": "Counting Sequences", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Your task is to count the number of sequences of length n where each element is an integer between 1 \\dots k and each integer between 1 \\dots k appears at least once in the sequence. \n For example, when n=6 and k=4, some valid sequences are [1,3,1,4,3,2] and [2,2,1,3,4,2]. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The only input line has two integers n and k. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the number of sequences modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^6", "Example Input": "6 4", "Example Output": "1560", "Number": 2228}
