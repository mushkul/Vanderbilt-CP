Then, there are some changes that invert one given bit. Your task is to report, after each change, the length of the longest substring whose each bit is the same. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has a bit string consisting of n bits. The bits are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. \n The next line contains an integer m: the number of changes. \n The last line contains m integers x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_m describing the changes. \n", "Output Specification": "\n After each change, print the length of the longest substring whose each bit is the same. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le x_i \\le n", "Example Input": "001011\n3\n3 2 5", "Example Output": "4 2 3", "Number": 1188}
