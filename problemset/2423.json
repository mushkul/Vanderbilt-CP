{"Title": "Filling Trominos", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Your task is to fill an n \\times m grid using L-trominos (three squares that have an L-shape). For example, here is one way to fill a 4 \\times 6 grid:\n \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer t: the number of tests. \n After that, there are t lines that describe the tests. Each line has two integers n and m. \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each test, print YES if there is a solution, and NO otherwise. \n If there is a solution, also print n lines that each contain m letters between A\u2013Z. Adjacent squares must have the same letter exactly when they belong to the same tromino. You can print any valid solution. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le t \\le 100\n1 \\le n,m \\le 100", "Example Input": "2\n4 6\n4 7", "Example Output": "YES\nAADDBB\nACCDEB\nBCAEEC\nBBAACC\nNO", "Number": 2423}
