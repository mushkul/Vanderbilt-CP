{"Title": "Shortest Routes II", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are n cities and m roads between them. Your task is to process q queries where you have to determine the length of the shortest route between two given cities. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has three integers n, m and q: the number of cities, roads, and queries. \n Then, there are m lines describing the roads. Each line has three integers a, b and c: there is a road between cities a and b whose length is c. All roads are two-way roads. \n Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers a and b: determine the length of the shortest route between cities a and b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the length of the shortest route for each query. If there is no route, print -1 instead. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 500\n1 \\le m \\le n^2\n1 \\le q \\le 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n\n1 \\le c \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "4 3 5\n1 2 5\n1 3 9\n2 3 3\n1 2\n2 1\n1 3\n1 4\n3 2", "Example Output": "5\n5\n8\n-1\n3", "Number": 1672}
