{"Title": "Road Construction", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are n cities and initially no roads between them. However, every day a new road will be constructed, and there will be a total of m roads. \n A component is a group of cities where there is a route between any two cities using the roads. After each day, your task is to find the number of components and the size of the largest component. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and roads. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Then, there are m lines describing the new roads. Each line has two integers a and b: a new road is constructed between cities a and b. \n You may assume that every road will be constructed between two different cities. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print m lines: the required information after each day. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 3\n1 2\n1 3\n4 5", "Example Output": "4 2\n3 3\n2 3", "Number": 1676}
