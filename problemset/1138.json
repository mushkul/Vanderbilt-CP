    "Description": "You are given a rooted tree consisting of n nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n, and node 1 is the root. Each node has a value. \n Your task is to process following types of queries: \n \nchange the value of node s to x\ncalculate the sum of values on the path from the root to node s\n \n",
    "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains two integers n and q: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. \n The next line has n integers v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_n: the value of each node. \n Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. \n Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each query is either of the form \"1 s x\" or \"2 s\". \n",
    "Output Specification": "\n Print the answer to each query of type 2. \n",
    "Constraints": "1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b, s \\le n\n1 \\le v_i, x \\le 10^9",
