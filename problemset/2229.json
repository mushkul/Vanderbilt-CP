{"Title": "Permutation Inversions", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Your task is to count the number of permutations of 1,2,\\dots,n that have exactly k inversions (i.e., pairs of elements in the wrong order). \n For example, when n=4 and k=3, there are 6 such permutations: \n \n[1,4,3,2]\n[2,3,4,1]\n[2,4,1,3]\n[3,1,4,2]\n[3,2,1,4]\n[4,1,2,3]\n \n", "Input Specification": "\n The only input line has two integers n and k. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the answer modulo 10^9+7. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 500\n0 \\le k \\le \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}", "Example Input": "4 3", "Example Output": "6", "Number": 2229}
