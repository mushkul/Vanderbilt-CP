{"Title": "Divisor Analysis", "Category": "Mathematics", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Given an integer, your task is to find the number, sum and product of its divisors. As an example, let us consider the number 12: \n \nthe number of divisors is 6 (they are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12)\nthe sum of divisors is 1+2+3+4+6+12=28\nthe product of divisors is 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 12 = 1728\n \n Since the input number may be large, it is given as a prime factorization. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first line has an integer n: the number of parts in the prime factorization. \n After this, there are n lines that describe the factorization. Each line has two numbers x and k where x is a prime and k is its power. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print three integers modulo 10^9+7: the number, sum and product of the divisors. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n2 \\le x \\le 10^6\neach x is a distinct prime\n1 \\le k \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "2\n2 2\n3 1", "Example Output": "6 28 1728", "Number": 2182}
