{"Title": "Critical Cities", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are n cities and m flight connections between them. A city is called a critical city if it appears on every route from a city to another city. \n Your task is to find all critical cities from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to Lehm\u00e4l\u00e4. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flights. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. City 1 is Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4, and city n is Lehm\u00e4l\u00e4. \n Then, there are m lines describing the connections. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a flight from city a to city b. All flights are one-way. \n You may assume that there is a route from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to Lehm\u00e4l\u00e4. \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print an integer k: the number of critical cities. After this, print k integers: the critical cities in increasing order. \n", "Constraints": "2 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 5\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n3 5\n4 5", "Example Output": "3\n1 2 5", "Number": 1703}
