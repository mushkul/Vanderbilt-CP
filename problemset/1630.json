{"Title": "Tasks and Deadlines", "Category": "Sorting and Searching", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You have to process n tasks. Each task has a duration and a deadline, and you will process the tasks in some order one after another. Your reward for a task is d-f where d is its deadline and f is your finishing time. (The starting time is 0, and you have to process all tasks even if a task would yield negative reward.) \n What is your maximum reward if you act optimally? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has an integer n: the number of tasks. \n After this, there are n lines that describe the tasks. Each line has two integers a and d: the duration and deadline of the task. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the maximum reward. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,d \\le 10^6", "Example Input": "3\n6 10\n8 15\n5 12", "Example Output": "2", "Number": 1630}
