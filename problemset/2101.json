{"Title": "New Roads Queries", "Category": "Advanced Techniques", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are n cities in Byteland but no roads between them. However, each day, a new road will be built. There will be a total of m roads. \n Your task is to process q queries of the form: \"after how many days can we travel from city a to city b for the first time?\" \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has three integers n, m and q: the number of cities, roads and queries. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After this, there are m lines that describe the roads in the order they are built. Each line has two integers a and b: there will be a road between cities a and b. \n Finally, there are q lines that describe the queries. Each line has two integers a and b: we want to travel from city a to city b. \n", "Output Specification": "\n For each query, print the number of days, or -1 if it is never possible. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n, m, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5 4 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n2 5\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5", "Example Output": "2\n-1\n4", "Number": 2101}
