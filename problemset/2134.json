{"Title": "Path Queries II", "Category": "Tree Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "You are given a tree consisting of n nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. Each node has a value. \n Your task is to process following types of queries: \n \nchange the value of node s to x\nfind the maximum value on the path between nodes a and b.\n \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains two integers n and q: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. \n The next line has n integers v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_n: the value of each node. \n Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. \n Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each query is either of the form \"1 s x\" or \"2 a b\". \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the answer to each query of type 2. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b, s \\le n\n1 \\le v_i, x \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "5 3\n2 4 1 3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n2 3 5\n1 2 2\n2 3 5", "Example Output": "4 3", "Number": 2134}
