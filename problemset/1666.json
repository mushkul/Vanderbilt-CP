{"Title": "Building Roads", "Category": "Graph Algorithms", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Byteland has n cities, and m roads between them. The goal is to construct new roads so that there is a route between any two cities. \n Your task is to find out the minimum number of roads required, and also determine which roads should be built. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and roads. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n After that, there are m lines describing the roads. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a road between those cities. \n A road always connects two different cities, and there is at most one road between any two cities. \n", "Output Specification": "\n First print an integer k: the number of required roads. \n Then, print k lines that describe the new roads. You can print any valid solution. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 10^5\n1 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "4 2\n1 2\n3 4", "Example Output": "1\n2 3", "Number": 1666}
