{"Title": "Parcel Delivery", "Category": "Advanced Techniques", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "There are n cities and m routes through which parcels can be carried from one city to another city. For each route, you know the maximum number of parcels and the cost of a single parcel. \n You want to send k parcels from Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 to Lehm\u00e4l\u00e4. What is the cheapest way to do that? \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line has three integers n, m and k: the number of cities, routes and parcels. The cities are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. City 1 is Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 and city n is Lehm\u00e4l\u00e4. \n After this, there are m lines that describe the routes. Each line has four integers a, b, r and c: there is a route from city a to city b, at most r parcels can be carried through the route, and the cost of each parcel is c. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print one integer: the minimum total cost or -1 if there are no solutions. \n", "Constraints": "2 \\le n \\le 500\n1 \\le m \\le 1000\n1 \\le k \\le 100\n1 \\le a,b \\le n\n1 \\le r,c \\le 1000", "Example Input": "4 5 3\n1 2 5 100\n1 3 10 50\n1 4 7 500\n2 4 8 350\n3 4 2 100", "Example Output": "750", "Number": 2121}
