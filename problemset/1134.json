{"Title": "Pr\u00fcfer Code", "Category": "Additional Problems", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "A Pr\u00fcfer code of a tree of n nodes is a sequence of n-2 integers that uniquely specifies the structure of the tree. \n The code is constructed as follows: As long as there are at least three nodes left, find a leaf with the smallest label, add the label of its only neighbor to the code, and remove the leaf from the tree. \n Given a Pr\u00fcfer code of a tree, your task is to construct the original tree. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\ldots,n. \n The second line contains n-2 integers: the Pr\u00fcfer code. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree. Each line has to contain two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b. You can print the edges in any order. \n", "Constraints": "3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5\n1 \\le a,b \\le n", "Example Input": "5\n2 2 4", "Example Output": "1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 5", "Number": 1134}
