{"Title": "Graph Paths II", "Category": "Mathematics", "Time Limit": "1.00 s", "Memory Limit": "512 MB", "Description": "Consider a directed weighted graph having n nodes and m edges. Your task is to calculate the minimum path length from node 1 to node n with exactly k edges. \n", "Input Specification": "\n The first input line contains three integers n, m and k: the number of nodes and edges, and the length of the path. The nodes are numbered 1,2,\\dots,n. \n Then, there are m lines describing the edges. Each line contains three integers a, b and c: there is an edge from node a to node b with weight c. \n", "Output Specification": "\n Print the minimum path length. If there are no such paths, print -1. \n", "Constraints": "1 \\le n \\le 100\n1 \\le m \\le n(n-1)\n1 \\le k \\le 10^9\n1 \\le a,b \\le n\n1 \\le c \\le 10^9", "Example Input": "3 4 8\n1 2 5\n2 3 4\n3 1 1\n3 2 2", "Example Output": "27", "Number": 1724}
